/**
 * The basic data unit in a QuickTime file is the atom. Each atom contains size
 * and type fields that precede any other data. The size field indicates the
 * total number of bytes in the atom, including the size and type fields. The
 * type field specifies the type of data stored in the atom and, by implication,
 * the format of that data. In some cases, the size and type fields are followed
 * by a version field and a flags field. An atom with these version and flags
 * fields is sometimes called a <b>full atom</b>.
